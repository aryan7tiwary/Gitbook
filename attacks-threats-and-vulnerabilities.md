35. **Bluesnarfing** involves accessing data from a Bluetooth device when it is in range.
    * **Bluejacking** involves sending unsolicited message to bluetooth device when they are in range.
36. **Segmentation falult** will typically stop thr program from running. This type of issue is why a - **NULL** pointer or other pointer dereferencing error is considered a potential security issue, as a **DoS** condition impact.
37. **Spinning account** refers to changing the password for an account, often because of compromise or to prevent a user from logging back into it while preserving the account.
38. **Pretexting** is a social engineering technique where attacker use a reason that is intended to be believable to the target for what they are doing.
39. **Prepending** information by inserting it to think about things the attacker wants them to.
40. **Refactoring** a program by automated means can include adding additional text, comments, or nonfunctional opetations to make the program have a different signature without changing its operation.
41. **"Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)"** collect, analyze and disseminate actionable threat information to their members and provide members with tools to mitigate risks and enhance resiliency.
42. **Piggybacking,** Gaining physical unauthorized access to the data center by using another user's credentials.
43. **Hyperlink spoofing**, which is also referred to as **Web spoofing**, is used by an attacker to persuade the Internet browser to connect to a fake server that appears as a valid session. The primary purpose of hyperlink spoofing is to gain access to confidential information, such as PIN numbers, credit card numbers, and bank details of users. This is also referred to as URL Spoofing.
44. **Tarpitting** : intentionally slowing down the server conversation to mitigate spam.
45. **Request for Comments (RFC)** standards are format for email. Block email which does not follow RFC standards to mitigate **spam**.
46. **Aggregation**: the formation of a number of things into a cluster. Merging log of an organization n number of days.
47. **STIX** and **TAXII** are tandards developed in an effort to improve the prevention and mitigation of cyber-attacks. **STIX** states the “**what**” of threat intelligence, while **TAXII** defines “**how**” that information is relayed. Unlike previous methods of sharing, STIX and TAXII are machine-readable and therefore easily automated.
48. **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** is a key concept in cybersecurity and threat intelligence. The purpose is to identify patterns of behavior which can be used to defend against specific strategies and threat vectors used by malicious actors.
49. Messaging spam, sometimes called **SPIM**, is a type of spam targeting users of **instant messaging services** (DMs).
50. **Obfuscation** means **to make something difficult to understand**. Programming code is often obfuscated to protect intellectual property or trade secrets, and to prevent an attacker from reverse engineering a proprietary software program.
51. Advantage of **Eliptical Curve Cryptosystem** over **RSA-based Cryptosystem** is that it can use smaller key length for the same resistance to be broken. ECC is faster.
52. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** is be
53. **Replication**: to make exact copy of; at the block level or hardware level.
54. Sender will use **Public key** of receiver to encrypt the data. Receiver will use its **Private key** to decrypt the data.
55. **US CERT Bulletin** is a major threat feed used in the security world. Created and maintained by CISA, they use **weekly** bulletins to provide summaries of new
56. A **debugging or maintenance hook** is software code that is intentionally embedded in the software during its development process to allow the developer to bypass the regular access and authentication mechanisms. These hooks can pose a threat to the security of the software and can be exploited if any maintenance hook is not removed before the software goes into production and an intruder is able to find the maintenance hook.
57. Packet sniffers monitor the data passing through the network by using **promiscuous mode**. In a normal networking environment, the data travels in clear text, making it easier for anyone to discover confidential information by using packet sniffers. **Promiscuous mode** provides a statistical picture of the network activity. **Promiscuous mode** is a special mode in which a network adapter card captures and analyzes all frames, including those that are not addressed to that network adapter.
58. A Web server stores persistent settings on a Web client in a text file called a cookie. In the case of **cookie poisoning**, a cookie is changed to modify persistent data on; the user that is associated with the cookie.
59. A **multipart virus** can infect both executable files and boot sectors of hard disk drives. The multipart virus resides in the memory and then infects boot sectors and executable files of the computer system.
60. **A Request for Comments (RFC)** is a numbered document, which includes appraisals, descriptions, and definitions of online protocols, concepts, methods, and programs.
61. **Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)** is a feed of threat indicators and defensive measures provided to the public by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Users can access it directly through CISA or indirectly through a third-party service.
62. A **smurf attack** is a combination of Internet Protocol (IP) spoofing and the saturation of a network with Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages. To initiate a smurf attack, a hacker sends ICMP messages from a computer outside a network with a spoofed IP address of a computer inside the network. The ICMP message is broadcast on the network, and the hosts on the network attempt to reply to the spurious ICMP message. A smurf attack causes a denial of service (DoS) on a network because computers are busy responding to the ICMP messages. The IP spoofing part of a smurf attack can be countered by configuring a router to ensure that messages with IP addresses inside the network originate on the private network side of the router.
63. A **well-written program** is the best method to prevent **buffer overflow** errors. Buffer overflow occurs when the length of the input data is longer than the length processor buffers can handle. Buffer overflow is caused when input data is not verified for appropriate length at the time of input. Buffer overflow and boundary condition errors are examples of input validation errors.
64. The scenario of being redirected to a malicious website from a legitimate one is a **man-in-the-browser attack**. The man (or malware) in the browser redirects the user to a fake site rather than the intended site.
65. **Hyperjacking** involves installing a rogue hypervisor that can take complete control of a server or workstation. Since cloud technologies heavily utilize virtual machines, hyperjacking is a major concern for cloud providers.
66. **Warchalking** refers to drawing symbols in public spaces to denote an open Wi-Fi wireless network in a public space.
67. **Initialization Vector (IV):** Used to randomize encryption scheme. More random → better.
68. **DHCP starvation:** Attacker floods a network with IP requests. MAC address changes every time. DHCP eventually runs out of addresses.
69. **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**: Detect Insider threat. Catches what SEIM and DPL system might miss.
70. A **polymorphic virus** is a harmful, destructive or intrusive type of malware that can change or "morph," making it difficult to detect with antimalware programs.
